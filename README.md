# zoom-automation-bot
Zoom class auto-joiner. Read this File (README.md) before using!


Step 1. Download the files.

Step 2. Run "chromedriver.exe". If it does not work please download the selenium chrome driver here ==> https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads and select the one for your chrome version.

Step 3. Open "revl.py" with visual studio code, If you do not have visual studio code go ahead and download it here ==> https://code.visualstudio.com/

Step 4. Once your in "revl.py" Go to where it says "driver = webdriver.Chrome("")" and add the path you saved this project in within the two quotations.

Step 5. Go to where it says "FirstClassTime = """ and within the quotations add the time your first class starts at in 24-hour format.

Step 6. Go to where it says "SecondClassTime = """ and within the quotations add the time your second class starts at in 24-hour format. If you have more than two classes just repeat the process.

Step 7. Go to where it says "main = """ and add your first class's zoom url and go to where it says "french = """ and add your second class's zoom url. Again, If you have more than two class's than just repeat the process.

If you didn't edit anything such as add more class times/urls and all that, Your bot should be ready! Hit the green "Run Python File In Terminal" in VSC or go to your folder that the script is saved in and double click revl.py to run it!

If you did edit it though, Please make sure the Times, Links, Join Functions, Weekly Timetable are all in sync.
If you get any errors feel free to mention it.
